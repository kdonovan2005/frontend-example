This a semi-working example of a frontend template that I created for a client. All of the client's photos and product images have been changed. The logo and name of the business has also been changed.

The current product images are pictures from Bloomingdales.com, the logo and name of the business were made up (any similarity to a real business is completely coincidental.)

This application is intended to showcase the html, css, and javascript used to create the components of the frontend. As such, there is no backend functionality. All products have been manually loaded into the layout.

A note on links -- all of the main navigation categories will link to the dresses page. All of the sub-category links from the categories page will link to 'casual dresses'.

The 'my list' modal will is pre-populated with 'saved' items. The clear button will not work. The e-mail function also does not work.
