This a working example of a front end template that I created for a client. All of the client's photos and product images have been changed. The logo and name of the business have also been changed.

The product images are pictures from Bloomingdales.com, the logo and name of the business were made up (any similarity to a real business is completely coincidental.) The other photo assets (including header images, etc.) are from either pexels.com or stocksnap.io.

This application is intended to showcase the html, css, and javascript used to create the components of the front end template: as such, there is no backend functionality. All products, categories, and sub-categories have been manually loaded into the layout.

A note on links -- all of the main navigation categories will link to the dresses category page. All of the sub-category links from the categories page will link to 'casual dresses'. All of the sub-category products will link to the same product page.

The 'my list' modal is pre-populated with 'saved' items. Since these items are manually loaded in the template, the "clear my list" button does not work. Likewise, there is no email functionality set up on the backend. The keyboard works and users may type into the text area using it, but no emails will be sent.

The design of the template is not my own. The site was designed by my client and I created the HTML, CSS, and JS to achieve the design as specified. The design was originally intended for large appliances.

If you have any questions regarding the template, please feel free to contact me.
